For Transcribe results

 * Bring up the debug menu by pressing Shift 3 times

 * Play the sample file you want
 * Once it's completely finished transcribing, hit "copy transcription results"
 * Paste the content into the corresponding JSON file

For Comprehend results

 * Replace the contents of `comprehension-cache.json` with: `{}`
 * Bring up the debug menu and disable offline mode as above
 * Play **all** four samples in sequence to generate the full cache (do this by going back to the start each time - don't refresh your browser window in between)
